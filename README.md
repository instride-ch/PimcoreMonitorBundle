This bundle provides a way to run a series of Pimcore and application related health checks. Health checks in the
scope of this bundle go beyond simple actions like performing a ping to a server to see if it's alive. For example
a Memcache server can be alive and not displaying any errors in your Nagios, but you might not be able to access it
from your PHP application. Each health check should then implement some application logic that you want to make
sure always works. Another usage can be testing for specific requirements, like availability of PHP extensions.

## Available Checks
- **DiskUsage:** Checks how much space is being allocated on the disk.
- **DoctrineMigrations:** Checks whether all Doctrine Migrations have been migrated.
- **HostingSize:** Checks how much Disk space is used by this hosting.
- **PhpFlags:** Checks whether certain PHP flags are enabled.
- **PhpVersion:** Checks what PHP version is configured.
- **PimcoreAreabricks:** Checks which Areabricks are installed within Pimcore.
- **PimcoreBundles:** Checks which Bundles are installed within Pimcore.
- **PimcoreElementCount:** Checks whether the count of Pimcore Elements exceeds a certain threshold.
- **PimcoreUsers:** Checks what Pimcore Users are configured.
- **PimcoreVersion:** Checks what Pimcore Version is installed.
